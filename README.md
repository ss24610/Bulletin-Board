# Bulletin-Board
Hello this is a test

#TO-DO
- make the client side GUI
- write the BulletinProtocol
    - this should take a string input from the GUI/client
    - parse and detect for validity
    - send to the BulletinServer and call the method
    - return the string from BulletinServer and show in GUI/client
    - i think
- finish BulletinServer methods
    - post_note
    - may be more methods i forgot
